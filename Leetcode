Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Approach 1: List operation
Algorithm

Iterate over all the elements in \text{nums}nums
If some number in \text{nums}nums is new to array, append it
If some number is already in the array, remove it
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        no_duplicate_list = []
        for i in nums:
            if i not in no_duplicate_list:
                no_duplicate_list.append(i)
            else:
                no_duplicate_list.remove(i)
        return no_duplicate_list.pop()
        
        
        Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n^2)O(n 
2
 ). We iterate through \text{nums}nums, taking O(n)O(n) time. We search the whole list to find whether there is duplicate number, taking O(n)O(n) time. Because search is in the for loop, so we have to multiply both time complexities which is O(n^2)O(n 
2
 ).

Space complexity : O(n)O(n). We need a list of size nn to contain elements in \text{nums}nums.


Approach 2: Hash Table
Algorithm

We use hash table to avoid the O(n)O(n) time required for searching the elements.

Iterate through all elements in nums and set up key/value pair.
Return the element which appeared only once.

from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hash_table = defaultdict(int)
        for i in nums:
            hash_table[i] += 1
        
        for i in hash_table:
            if hash_table[i] == 1:
                return i
                
  Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n \cdot 1) = O(n)O(n⋅1)=O(n). Time complexity of for loop is O(n)O(n). Time complexity of hash table(dictionary in python) operation pop is O(1)O(1).

Space complexity : O(n)O(n). The space required by hash\_tablehash_table is equal to the number of elements in \text{nums}nums.



Approach 3: Math
Concept

2 * (a + b + c) - (a + a + b + b + c) = c2∗(a+b+c)−(a+a+b+b+c)=c

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)
        
 Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n). sum will call next to iterate through nums. We can see it as sum(list(i, for i in nums)) which means the time complexity is O(n)O(n) because of the number of elements(nn) in nums.

Space complexity : O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n). set needs space for the elements in nums


Approach 4: Bit Manipulation
Concept

If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
a xor 0 = aa⊕0=a
If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0
a xor a = a⊕a=0
a xor b xor a = (a xor a) xor b = 0 xor b = ba⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b
So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.


class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        a = 0
        for i in nums:
            a ^= i
        return a
        
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n)O(n). We only iterate through \text{nums}nums, so the time complexity is the number of elements in \text{nums}nums.

Space complexity : O(1)O(1).
